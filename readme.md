A simple web application for managing celebrity profiles, events, and bookings using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

2. Place them in the same directory
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Usage Notes

3. Basic CRUD operations for Celebrities and Events
4. Simple Navigation
5. Booking Inquiry Submission

Key Points:

To use the application:

4. Use the forms and buttons to interact with the platform

Limitations to be aware of:

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the application or explain how any specific feature works?
